					<p>I created this place because my line of specialty that is in front-end design and tutoring and also a little graphics knowledge. I am creating an internet hub where all the things that I have done, am doing, and want to do can live.</p>

<p>I dont just want this place to be about me; that would suck. i am putting it out there on the interwebs, rather than in my personal computer because you know that's not good for business and I want to work with you.</p>

<p>Whether its me to you, a client to an audience, a friend to their dream job, an intern to an mentor, a sponsor to a conference, a speaker to a panel â€¦ this is what I love about the internet. Everything that it makes possible; every (zillion) doors it opens that were never there before.</p>

<p>I think of the web as One Big Warm Fuzzy just waiting to happen. Because I have seen it time and time again, and I love nothing more than being the person who makes that happen.</p>

<p>Sound good right? Great. Talk soon!<p>
